DB file password protection
===========================

* If the DB is password-protected, all private keys will be crypted.
* The password will be asked only whenever the private keys are used or created.
* There's an option for remembering the password throughout all the session.
* When creating the DB file there's a question asking if the file is going to be password-protected.
* There's an option for establishing or changing the password.

Which password to use for crypting all the private keys
=======================================================

In gnoMint, all the private keys saved in the DB must be associated to
a certificate or CSR.

For making more difficult to attack a gnoMint DB using
password-repetition analysis, a different password will be used for
crypting the private keys.

This password can be obtained using the next method:

g_strdup_sprintf ("gnoMintPrivateKey%s%s", db_password, cert_or_csr_dn);
