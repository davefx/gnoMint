Year 2038 (Y2K38) Support
--------------------------

gnoMint is designed to handle certificates with expiration dates beyond 
January 19, 2038 (the Year 2038 problem). The application uses 64-bit 
time_t values to ensure proper handling of dates far into the future.

The following measures have been implemented:
- Compile-time flags (_TIME_BITS=64, _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64) to ensure 
  64-bit time_t even on 32-bit systems
- Static assertions to verify time_t is 64-bit at compile time
- Support for certificate expiration dates well beyond 2038

This ensures gnoMint can safely create and manage certificates with 
validity periods extending decades into the future.
