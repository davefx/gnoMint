To-do list in gnoMint
=====================

  - Issues about certificates expiration:

    * Visual distinction

    * Checkings for avoiding the use of certificates later than their
      expiring date.  (Perhaps allowing it in a hidden
      non-standard-compliant mode??)

  - Support for Issuer and Subject alternative names

  - Support for CRL distribution point

  - Allow deleting imported certificates (perhaps deleting whole
    certificate hierarchies).

  - Option to re-new certificate -> generate CSR from Cert.

  - While importing a certificate, detect if it corresponds to a
    previous CSR and, perhaps after asking, copy its private key as
    the private key of the new certificate.

  - Implement revoking causes, and CRL serial number.
    (Support for these subjects must be previously implemented in GnuTLS).
