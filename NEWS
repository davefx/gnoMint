* Version 0.3.2 (2007.11.03)

- FIX: Fixing database upgrading from version 3 (gnoMint 0.1.5 or
  lower).

* Version 0.3.1 (2007.11.01)

- FEATURE: now, PKCS#12 structures can be exported, so certificates
  created in gnoMint can be easily imported in other programs as web
  browsers, or mail clients.

- FEATURE: gnoMint is able to revoke certificates, and generate the
  corresponding Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).

- FEATURE: gnoMint license has changed to GNU-GPLv3.

- FIX: Fixed a lot of compilation errors in x86-64 architecture.

- FIX: Fixing internal serial number in created certificates.


* Version 0.1.5 (2007.05.15)

- FEATURE: gnoMint can import the public part of Certificate Signing
  Requests made by other applications as long as they are formatted in
  PEM or in DER formats. This way, gnoMint now is able to make
  certificates for remote people or systems that can create their CSRs
  with other instances of gnoMint or other software.

- FEATURE: gnoMint DB format version 3. This version of database
  format ensures that there won't be two or more CSRs in the database
  with the same Distinguished Name (DN).

- FIX: Now the private key of CSRs can be exported without errors.

- FIX: A just created CA has a default policy so it will be able to
  create useful certificates without change its default properties.

- FIX: Some UI bugs are corrected: some label alignments now look OK,
  and the progress bar again moves while creating certificates or
  CSRs.

* Version 0.1.4 (2007.05.14)

- FEATURE: It allows defining policies for each Certification
  Authorities in the database, so as all the new certificates signed
  by the CA have common properties (uses, purposes and validity time).

- FEATURE: It requires SQLite3, for proper UTF-8 support. Due to this
  change, all the pre 0.1.4 databases must be converted to a new
  format. A conversion script is included in the package.


* Version 0.1.3 (2006.11.10)

- FEATURE: it allows exporting uncrypted private keys (useful for
  unattended SSL/TLS servers).

- FEATURE: it requires a minimum length (8 characters) for private-key
  export passphrase (so OpenSSL can import this keys)

- FIX: checks that passphrase and confirmation are the same in
  private-key export passphrase

- FIX: The focus is grabbed correctly when asking for passphrase, so
  no mouse action is needed.

* Version 0.1.2 (2006.10.15)

- FIX: version 0.1.1 couldn't save the certification authority
  database if the new file and /tmp were in different partitions.

* Version 0.1.1 (2006.09.17)

- FIX: version 0.1.0 couldn't be compiled on 64-bit architectures due to an type-conversion error

* Version 0.1.0 (2006.09.15)

- Initial version
